        <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
        <p>
          "A man, a plan, a coffee bean". Okay, that doesn't make a palindrome, but it resulted
          in a damn good cup of coffee. Starbuzz's CEO is that man, and you already know his
          plan: a Starbuzz on every corner.
        </p>
        <p>In only a few years he's executed that plan and today
          you can enjoy Starbuzz just about anywhere. And, of course, the big news this year
          is that Starbuzz teamed up with Head First readers to create Starbuzz's Web presence,
          which is growing rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs of a whole new set of
          customers.
